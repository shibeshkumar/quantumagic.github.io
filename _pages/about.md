Hi,
I am Dr. Shibesh Kumar Jas Pacif, a cosmologist, relativist, science popularizer and mathematician.

I have obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics from Banaras Hindu University and completed three years of post-doctoral research at Centre for Theoretical Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India (funded by NBHM-DAE, Govt. of India). For details of education see [here.](https://shibeshkumar.github.io/cv/)

My research works are mainly focused on some hot topics of mainstream cosmology such as dark energy models, cosmic acceleration, singularity problem, age problem, Hubble tension, cosmologic al parametrization and exact solutions in standard cosmology as well as in some modified theories of gravity.
